## What is AI Video Automation?

AI Video Automation is the process of using artificial intelligence to automate video production steps — from scriptwriting, image generation, voice-over to final editing.

## FlashCut's Multi-AI Architecture

FlashCut doesn't rely on a single AI. We combine **over 10 specialized AI providers**:

### Language Processing
- **Gemini Pro** — script analysis and content optimization
- **Claude** — creative content and copywriting
- **GPT-4** — complex natural language processing

### Image Generation
- **Midjourney** — high-quality artistic images
- **Flux** — fast image generation with diverse styles

### Voice & Audio
- **ElevenLabs** — natural multi-language voice synthesis
- **Deepgram** — speech-to-text with 95.5% accuracy

### Automation
- **CapCut Builder V3** — automated CapCut project creation
- **Groq** — high-speed inference for real-time processing

## How Does the Pipeline Work?

1. **Input** → JSON script or plain text
2. **AI Processing** → Analysis, prompt generation, media creation
3. **Assembly** → Timeline assembly, effects, transitions
4. **Output** → CapCut project ready for export

## Real Results

With FlashCut, video production time drops **from 4-6 hours to just 15 minutes**. Output quality matches professional studio standards.
